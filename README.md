Independent study with Dr. Sheaffer for controlling audio systems.

## mca66d

Written in [go](https://golang.org).

Tested on go1.10 linux/amd64.

### dependencies

The single dependency is vendored from `aa76b0035d1239b7bb3ae1bd84cd88ef2e0a1f1e`.

- [daemon library by takama](https://github.com/takama/daemon)
- [daemon library godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/takama/daemon)

_Note_: Takama's daemon lib does not pull any further dependencies and is built only on the stdlib, it is tolerated for this reason.

### build

	make daemon

### install

This installs mca66d as a service in Linux (probably also \*BSD).

	make daemon install

### uninstall

	make daemon uninstall

### using

Start service with:

	sudo service mca66d start

### notes

- Default logging is to /var/log/mca66.log
- Default service is installed as `mca66d`

## cntl

### build

	make cntl

## interface

### dependencies

Necessary for Ubuntu (and probably Debian), probably missing some:

	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

ICFLAGS generated by:

	pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0

### build

	make interface

## bugs

- interface's build says it's broken, but it builds interface just fine.
- Currently incomplete.
